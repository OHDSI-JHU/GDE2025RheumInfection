**Background**: Despite its cardiovascular and kidney benefits, semaglutide has been recently linked to severe ophthalmic complications including non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) as well as worsening of diabetic retinopathy (DR).

**Purpose**: To estimate the risk of these ophthalmic complications, NAION and DR worsening, with semaglutide use compared with other GLP-1 RAs (dulaglutide, and exenatide), and non-GLP-1 RA medications (including empagliflozin, sitagliptin, and glipizide) among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. To estimate the relative incidence rate of NAION and DR worsening associated with with GLP-1 RAs and non-GLP-1 RAs exposure compared with non-exposure.

**Design**: Retrospective study employing 1) an active comparator, new-user cohort design, 2) self-controlled case series.

**Subjects**: Adults (â‰¥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are users of semaglutide (a GLP-1 RA), dulaglutide (a GLP-1 RA), exenatide (a GLP-1 RA), empagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor), sitagliptin (a DPP4 inhibitor), or glipizide (a sulfonylurea)

**Methods**: 1) New-User active Comparator Cohort Design: Patients who are new-users of semaglutide will be compared to propensity score matched patients with each of the other GLP-1 RA and non-GLP-1 RA medications. We will deploy the large-scale propensity score method that adjusts for a comprehensive range of baseline characteristics. Cox models will be used to compare the time to NAION or DR worsening between patients who receive semaglutide with patients who receive empagliflozin, sitagliptin, and glipizide. Similar comparisons will be made between the other GLP-1 RA (dulaglutide and exenatide) with each of the comparators. 2) Self-Controlled Case Series: the incidence rate of NAION during periods of exposure with each of the T2DM medications will be compared to the incidence rate of NAION during control periods of non-exposure using Poisson regression models.

**Conclusions**: Clarifying the risk of severe ophthalmic complications associated with semaglutide (and other GLP-1 RA) by 1) characterizing the incidence in the exposed population, and 2) estimating the risk of exposure will help guide the appropriate use of this medication.
